# Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

Available at: https://www.ferdymacleod.com

This application was built with create-react-app, I wanted to keep it small and simple and show off mainly my projects. I designed it myself with figma but used material-ui here and there for little things.

If you find any bugs/want to review my code all feedback is appreciated very much as I am a junior!
